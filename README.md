# Welcome to Harinandan's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Harinandan**, a tech enthusiast with a passion for innovation and development. At 16 years old, Iâ€™m working on a variety of cutting-edge projects that focus on game development, custom operating systems, robotics, and accessibility technology. From creating a robotic arm and 2D games to building a Linux-based OS and smart goggles for the blind, I strive to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

### My Key Projects:
- **2D Games**: Developed engaging platformer games using Unity, focusing on fun themes like snow, desert, and more. I aim to create unique and modern game experiences that stand out from the crowd.
- **Robotic Arm with 3D Printed Controller**: Built a robotic arm integrated with a 3D printed controller, utilizing Unreal Engine and Arduino for seamless control and interaction.
- **Custom Linux OS**: Developed a Linux-based OS capable of running Android, Windows, and Linux apps, now working on a game development-optimized Linux distro free of tracking elements.
- **Accessibility Tech for the Blind**: Currently working on goggles that communicate with the brain to provide visual images through a camera without surgery.

## Technologies I Work With:
- **Game Development**: Unity, Unreal Engine, C#
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu, XFCE, Linux Optimization
- **Programming Languages**: C#, Python, Arduino
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Jupyter
- **Hardware**: Arduino, 3D Printing

## Ongoing Projects:
1. **Smart Goggles for the Blind**: Innovating a way to use cameras and brain interfaces to allow the blind to visualize the world around them.
2. **Custom Linux Distribution**: Creating a lightweight, optimized Linux distribution specifically for game developers with all free and open-source tools.

## Goals
I aim to build a **partnership company called Xtendz** to help developers improve their skills and projects for free. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for collaborators and donations to further support this mission.
